## **Summary**

### **This is my first react project, created for ReactJS course exam. Application is focused on practicing react base concepts like state, hooks, context api and routing.**

## **[Live Demo]()**
‚ùó **In Live Demo sometimes may be a delay with the data which is coming from the server, because the server is deployed in Render using a free plan**.

1. Guest users functionality:

-   They can access home page, about, register and login pages.
-   They can access catalog with all recipes and more information about specific recipe.
-   They can't make any CRUD operations.

2. Logged In users functionality:

-   Users can perform CRUD operations.
-   Edit and Delete only if this user is author of the recipe.
-   They can like or dislike each recipe (only once).
-   If user visit details page of specific recipe, this recipe views will be increased by 1 (only first visit)
-   User can change his profile picture in profile page.
-   User can track information about his recipe's views in profile page.

# **Server**

### This server provides just **base functionality** to save your entries in JSON and retrieve them to perform CRUD operations. _**The server has too limited capabilities**_.

1. Doesn't persist any data after restart.
2. Doesn't provide total count of entries in collections.
3. If you aren't creator of the entry, server doesn't allow you to make changes.So you can't store likes, views etc as recipe property.
4. Supports very few types of relations.
